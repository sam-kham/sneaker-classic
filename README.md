# Sneaker Classic 

Sneaker Classic is a website developed and designed for a fictional client.  I wanted to create a responsive website that would allow visitors to view the website on desktops, tablets and mobile devices.  HTML, CSS, jQuery, and PHP were used to complete this project.

I have collaborated with an aspiring UI designer, Tony Sivilay, to come up with the layout for this project.
